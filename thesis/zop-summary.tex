This chapter presented \zop, a system for zero-overhead profiling which is non-intrusive and requires no hardware modifications or support. In exchange for the ability to profile software without any overhead, \zop\ makes a small sacrifice in accuracy ($>$ 94\% accurate compared to a technique based on instrumentation on the benchmarks tested), and requires a training phase.

\zop\ uses unintentional EM emanations generated by the profiled system to track a program's execution and to generate profiling information. In \zop's training phase, the program is instrumented and EM waveforms are recorded while running a set of inputs on both instrumented and uninstrumented code, and the instrumentation records which part of the EM signal corresponds to which part of the code. The profiling phase consists of running the original (uninstrumented and unmodified) program with the inputs to be profiled and recording the system's EM emanations waveforms. The waveforms from training, and their waveform-to-code mapping, are used to predict the execution path taken by the profiled run. Our experimental results show that \zop\ can predict profiling information with greater than 94\% accuracy for the benchmarks considered in our evaluation.
